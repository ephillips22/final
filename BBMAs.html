   <h1>The BBMAs</h1>

 </br>
 </br>
 <p><strong>Last night (May 20th) was a big night for music and for BTS. They won the Top
   Social Artist Award at an American award show for the second year in a row!</br> The boys also
   performed their new song "Fake Love" to a roaring crowd of ARMY (BTS fans) for the first time!
   They met DJ Khalid, Taylor Swift, Pharell Williams, and many other stars they idolize (while wearing all Gucci of course)!

 <p>Note: Just like English, there are many ways to say the same thing.
    These are not the formal, official terms to use, but they are the
     ones I have learned through listening to a <strong>lot</strong> of KPOP!
