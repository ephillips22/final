      <li><em><strong>Jeon Jungkook</em></strong></li><p>Jungkook, the youngest member,
         is often noted as the most talented. He can sing (really well), dance
          (amazingly), eat, and play video games like nobody's business. </br>His charms have earned
          attention from Western stars such as Charlie Puth with his cover
           of Charlie's song, "We Don't Talk Anymore". He's practically perfect so there's not much more
            to say other than that he is my third favorite member.</p>

  <li><em><strong>Kim Taehyung/V</em></strong></li><p>Named the most handsome face of 2017 on the TC Candler Annual
     Independent Critics List,
    V catches attention wherever he goes.
    On their trip to America for the BBMAs, V's looks caught the eyes of many non-K-pop fans.
    V is also a singer in the group, but is interested in all aspects of the arts, especially fashion.</br>
     V is known as the most fashionable of the group and for good reason.</p>

  <li><em><strong>Kim Seokjin/Jin</em></strong></li><p>Jin, the oldest member of the group was surprisingly
     not added to the group for his vocal abilities, but for his looks.
    Jin was nicknamed "Worldwide Handsome" by himself</br> and was even recognized for it at a Korean awards show.
     He is a great cook and takes care of the other members also earning
     the nickname "Mamma Jin" for his caring and love of the color pink. He and RM are also known for not being the best dancers.</p>

  <li><em><strong>Kim Namjoon/RM</em></strong></li><p>Birthname Kim Namjoon stagename RM (formerly RapMonster).
         RM is the leader of BTS and is fluent in English thanks to his mom's
         gift of the complete Friends series! </br>
         RM is a rapper in the group, produces, and
          has done one singing cover with another member, Jungkook. His solo mixtape, "RM" was released in 2015.

      <li><em><strong>Park Jimin</em></strong></li><p>Jimin, my favorite member, is the multi-talented singer/dancer
        phenomena that took Korea by surprise.
         Trained as a classical dancer,
        Jimin quickly switched to interpretive dance and now uses his style to create some of BTS' most iconic dances such
        as the dance in the beginning of "Save Me".</br>His angellic vocals and
        flexibility have earned him solo dance stages and spots judging singing competetions in Korea.
        He opened the previous BTS album up with his single, "Serendipity".</p>

      <li><em><strong>Min Yoongi/Suga</em></strong></li><p>Yoongi, my second favorite member, is the second oldest and often
         most mature of the group.
        Yoongi is a rapper in the group and has produced myriad songs for the group and for other artists. He, like RM and
         Jin, was once a
         pretty bad dancer, but they have all improved since their debut in 2013. </br>Yoongi is known for his deep voice
          and is listed
         as the second fastest rapper in Korea. His mixtape, "Agust D" came out in 2016 under their company, BigHit.</p>

      <li><em><strong>Jung Hoesok/J-Hope</em></strong></li><p>J-Hope, the last member is known as the sunshine of the group.
         His smile and contagious laughter make everyone happy, despite their hardships. J-Hope's mixtape, "Hope World" was
         released on March 2nd of this year and attracted attention from a suprising Western star, John Cena.</br> Yes, it's true,
          a wrestler from America likes BTS and his bias (favorite member) is in fact J-Hope. J-Hope's energy and great dance skills
           makes him the lead of the "dance line" (the members that are best known for their dance skills) and he is also a member of
            "rap line" a.k.a the rappers of the group.</p>
